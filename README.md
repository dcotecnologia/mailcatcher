# MailCatcher Updated

Catches mail and serves it through a dream.

## About the project

This is a fork of MailCatcher that runs a super simple SMTP server which catches any message sent to it to display in a web interface. Run mailcatcher, set your favourite app to deliver to smtp://localhost:1025 instead of your default SMTP server, then check out http://localhost:1080 to see the mail that's arrived so far.

The main differences about our projects are:

- I want to follow another way than make it a gem. At my viewpoint I prefer to spend some time to make it better as an dockerized API. I removed everything that made it look like this project is a simple gem, without changing the essence as a service;
- Basic HTTP auth available.

## How to run this project

```sh
cp .env.sample .env
docker-compose up --build
```

Go to <http://localhost:1080> and send mail through <smtp://localhost:1025>.

## Use the public docker image (production)

```dockerfile
FROM dcotecnologia:latest
```

## Setup the env vars to use the basic auth

```ini
MAILCATCHER_AUTH_USER=thomas
MAILCATCHER_AUTH_PASSWORD=turbando
```

## Features

- Catches all mail and stores it for display.
- Shows HTML, Plain Text and Source version of messages, as applicable.
- Rewrites HTML enabling display of embedded, inline images/etc and opens links in a new window.
- Lists attachments and allows separate downloading of parts.
- Download original email to view in your native mail client(s).
- Command line options to override the default SMTP/HTTP IP and port settings.
- Mail appears instantly if your browser supports websockets, otherwise updates every thirty seconds.
- Runs as a daemon in the background, optionally in foreground.
- Sendmail-analogue command, `catchmail`, makes using mailcatcher from PHP a lot easier.
- Keyboard navigation between messages

        --version                    Display the current version
```

### Rails

To set up your rails app, I recommend adding this to your `environments/development.rb`:

```ruby
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = { :address => '127.0.0.1', :port => 1025 }
config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false
```

### PHP

For projects using PHP, or PHP frameworks and application platforms like Drupal, you can set [PHP's mail configuration](https://www.php.net/manual/en/mail.configuration.php) in your [php.ini](https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.file.php) to send via MailCatcher with:

```php
sendmail_path = /usr/bin/env catchmail -f some@from.address
```

You can do this in your [Apache configuration](https://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.changes.php) like so:

```php
php_admin_value sendmail_path "/usr/bin/env catchmail -f some@from.address"
```

If you've installed via RVM this probably won't work unless you've manually added your RVM bin paths to your system environment's PATH. In that case, run `which catchmail` and put that path into the `sendmail_path` directive above instead of `/usr/bin/env catchmail`.

If starting `mailcatcher` on alternative SMTP IP and/or port with parameters like `--smtp-ip 192.168.0.1 --smtp-port 10025`, add the same parameters to your `catchmail` command:

```php
sendmail_path = /usr/bin/env catchmail --smtp-ip 192.160.0.1 --smtp-port 10025 -f some@from.address
```

### Django

For use in Django, add the following configuration to your projects' settings.py

```python
if DEBUG:
    EMAIL_HOST = '127.0.0.1'
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = ''
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = ''
    EMAIL_PORT = 1025
    EMAIL_USE_TLS = False
```

### Docker

There is a Docker image available [on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sj26/mailcatcher):

```sh
docker run -p 1080 -p 1025 sj26/mailcatcher

Status: Downloaded newer image for sj26/mailcatcher:latest
Starting MailCatcher v0.9.0
==> smtp://0.0.0.0:1025
==> http://0.0.0.0:1080
```

How those ports appear and can be accessed may vary based on your Docker configuration. For example, your may need to use `http://127.0.0.1:1080` etc instead of the listed address. But MailCatcher will run and listen to those ports on all IPs it can from within the Docker container.

### API

A fairly RESTful URL schema means you can download a list of messages in JSON from `/messages`, each message's metadata with `/messages/:id.json`, and then the pertinent parts with `/messages/:id.html` and `/messages/:id.plain` for the default HTML and plain text version, `/messages/:id/parts/:cid` for individual attachments by CID, or the whole message with `/messages/:id.source`.

## Thanks

MailCatcher is just a mishmash of other people's hard work. Thank you so much to the people who have built the wonderful guts on which this project relies. Thanks to all the contributors from the [original repo](sj26/mailcatcher).
